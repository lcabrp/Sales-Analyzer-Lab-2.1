Sales Analyzer Lab 2.1 Files
This repository contains the starting files for the Sales Analyzer Lab 2.1 in your Code:You Course. The primary goal of this lab is to use GitHub Copilot Chat to analyze and understand code written in your language of chocie.

Prerequisites
Visual Studio Code with the GitHub Copilot extension installed and active.
The repository content must be open in your VS Code workspace.
## Environment Setup and Running Files

To run the analyzer and sales files in Python, JavaScript, or C#, follow these steps:

### 1. Install Required Runtimes
- **Python**: Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Node.js**: Download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
- **.NET SDK**: Download and install .NET SDK from [dotnet.microsoft.com](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

### 2. Recommended VS Code Extensions
- **Code Runner** (by Jun Han): Allows you to run code files directly in VS Code.
- **Python**: Provides Python language support.
- **C#**: Provides C# language support.
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Built-in support in VS Code.

### 3. Running the Files
- **Python**: Open the `.py` file and click the Run button, or use the terminal:
	```
	python analyzer.py
	python sales.py
	```
- **JavaScript**: Open the `.js` file and click the Run button, or use the terminal:
	```
	node analyzer.js
	node sales.js
	```
- **C#**: Open the `.cs` file and click the Run button, or use the terminal:
	```
	dotnet run
	```
	(Make sure your workspace settings are configured to use `dotnet run` for C# files with Code Runner.)

### 4. Additional Notes
- Ensure you have the required runtime installed for the language you want to use.
- If you encounter issues running C# files, check your workspace settings to confirm Code Runner uses `dotnet run`.
